Scan (Prefix Sum) Implementation
This folder contains the implementation of the Scan (Prefix Sum) algorithm in different parallel computing frameworks. 
The Scan algorithm is used to efficiently compute the prefix sum of an input array.

Files
scan_serial.cpp: Serial implementation of the Scan algorithm in C++.
scan_omp.cpp: OpenMP implementation of the Scan algorithm in C++.
scan_mpi.c: MPI implementation of the Scan algorithm in C.

Usage
To compile and run the different implementations, simply run the run.sh file.
